# PizzaRace
I built this game for The Tech Academy's C++ and Unreal Engine course. It features a candidate for an elite pizza delivery service. He only needs to complete this final pizza deliver obstacle course to get the job that will lead him to fame and glory. But will he be able make it to the end before the time is up? That depends on you!

This is a third person jumping puzzle game where you have to beat the clock in your quest to reach the highest platform with the glowing crystal before the time runs out!
